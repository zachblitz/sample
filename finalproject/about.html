        <p>My name is Zachary Blitz and I am a Senior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information. I am majoring in Information with a concentration in Information Analysis, while also pursuing a minor in Economics. I am a member of the Market Research Team in the Michigan Advertising and Marketing Club, and am also a competitor in IM Sports. I am hardworking, very personable, an extremely quick learner and love to work collaboratively.
        In the Summer of 2017 I was an acquisitions intern for a real estate investment firm, Spirit Investment Partners. I conducted some financial analysis and created an investment presentation for a portfolio of properties for investors. A year later, one of the properties in the portfolio deal was bought for 17MM.
        In the Summer of 2018 I was an advanced analytics intern at a digital marketing company, 360i. Using Python and PostgreSQL I created two automated end-to-end data pipelines for the advanced analytics department, resulting in new insights for two clients. When defining project requirements, I acted as a liaison between the digital analytics and data engineering teams. I also used SQL to create data visualizations for client dashboards.
        Outside of school and work, I am a very large basketball guy. I love everything basketball - playing, watching, refereeing, and coaching. My senior year I was the captain of my High School Varsity Team and received an All-County Basketball Award.</p>
